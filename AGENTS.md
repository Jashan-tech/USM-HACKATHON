## What I Want From AI Tools

1. **Surface connections I haven't seen.** Find links between projects, ideas, and notes.
2. **Challenge my assumptions.** Don't agree with me — find the gap in my thinking.
3. **When I ask what to focus on** — answer from vault context, not generically.
4. **Flag contradictions.** If something I saved earlier contradicts something new, call it out.
5. **Be concise.** No preamble. No fluff. Direct answers. Tables over paragraphs.
6. **Save durable insights.** Update this vault. Compound the knowledge.

## Behavioral Contract — 12 Rules

> Each rule prevents a specific observed failure mode. Source: Forrest Chang's 6-week, 30-codebase study built on Karpathy's January 2026 thread. Compliance holds ~76% for 12 rules; past 14 rules drops to 52%.
> **Any rule that hasn't prevented a real failure in 4 weeks gets dropped.** This is a living contract, not a museum.

### Before Writing Code
| # | Rule | Prevents |
|---|------|----------|
| R1 | **State assumptions explicitly.** If uncertain, ask. Stop when confused. Name what's unclear. | Silent wrong assumptions |
| R2 | **Read before writing.** Before adding code, read exports, callers, shared utilities. | Code conflicts 30 lines away |
| R3 | **Minimum code that solves the problem.** Nothing speculative. No abstractions for single-use code. Would a senior engineer call it overcomplicated? Simplify. | Over-engineering |

### While Writing Code
| # | Rule | Prevents |
|---|------|----------|
| R4 | **Touch only what you must.** Don't refactor adjacent code. Match existing style. Clean up only your own mess. | Orthogonal damage |
| R5 | **Model only for judgment calls.** Use for: classification, drafting, summarization. NOT for: routing, retries, deterministic transforms. If code can answer, code answers. | Flaky AI-driven business logic |
| R6 | **Match conventions, even if you disagree.** snake_case → snake_case. class components → class components. If you think the convention is harmful, surface it — don't fork silently. | Convention drift across 16 projects |
| R7 | **Surface conflicts, don't average them.** If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent/tested). Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup. | Incoherent blended code |

### Verifying Work
| # | Rule | Prevents |
|---|------|----------|
| R8 | **Define success, then iterate.** Don't follow steps. Define what done looks like and loop until verified. | Aimless iteration |
| R9 | **Tests verify intent, not just behavior.** A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong. | Shallow tests passing while production breaks |
| R10 | **Fail loud.** "Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently. "Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped. Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it. | Silent failures compounding across 7 tools |

### Session Management
| # | Rule | Prevents |
|---|------|----------|
| R11 | **Hard token budgets.** Per-task: 4,000 tokens. Per-session: 30,000 tokens. Summarize and start fresh when approaching the limit. Surface the breach. | Agent spirals, 90-minute loops |
| R11b | **One ticket equals one session equals one context window.** If a task cannot be finished and verified in a single session without compaction, it is not a ticket. It is a spec that has not been broken down yet. Session state goes to `{project_root}/.session/active.md`. | Work that overruns its budget invisibly, and mis-sized tickets read as expensive rather than wrong |
| R12 | **Checkpoint every significant step.** Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left. Don't continue from a state you can't describe back. If you lose track, stop and restate. | Multi-step refactors losing state |
| R13 | **Drain the backlog before closing.** Before ending any session: scan for features, ideas, or changes discussed but not implemented. Write each one to `BACKLOG.md` in the project root (create if absent). Format: `- [ ] [YYYY-MM-DD] [tool] Item — one-line context`. Never let a discussed idea die in session context. | Ideas discussed in one session, never surfaced again |

### Exceptions
- **Prototypes / spikes:** R3 and R9 are relaxed — speculative code and shallow tests are acceptable.
- **Single-file scripts:** R2, R4, and R10 are relaxed.
- **Trivial tasks:** R1 and R12 are relaxed.

### Rule Expiration — 4-Week Auto-Prune
After each Weekly Synthesis (Monday 8am), Hermes reviews the 12 rules against the vault's work log:
- **If a rule prevented zero real failures in 4 weeks** → flag for removal.
- **If a new failure mode appears** → propose a new rule.
- Target: stay at 10-14 rules. Add one → drop one.
- **Failure tracking:** `Knowledge/rules-fired.md` — `YYYY-MM-DD | R# | what the rule prevented`.

---

## Formatting Hard Stops

These apply to ALL output across ALL tools. No exceptions.

- No em dashes. Restructure the sentence.
- No hyphens in compound modifiers (write "real time" not "real-time").
- No filler adverbs: "really", "truly", "incredibly", "genuinely", "seamlessly",
  "effortlessly", "robustly", "leveraging", "utilizing".
- No bullet lists in final deliverables (emails, letters, pitch scripts) unless explicitly requested.
- No preamble before a deliverable. Output first.
- No post-summary after a deliverable. End at the last line.
- One clarifying question max per response.
- Active voice in all operational and instructional writing.
- End every response with a concrete next step or ask. Never end with "let me know if you need anything."

## Rule Shape (added 2026-08-21)

A rule that records only the symptom gets obeyed literally and defeated anyway. "Never do A" is
followed to the letter by a weak model while whatever produced A walks straight past it. The 12-rule
contract already solves this with its **Prevents** column; every rule added since dropped it.

Durable rules carry four fields. **The Directive is verbatim and is never softened or paraphrased**,
so precise execution is preserved. The rest exist so a capable model can generalize, and so the rule
set can be audited.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Directive** | The verbatim instruction |
| **Prevents** | The concrete failure observed, with the date |
| **Root cause** | What actually produced it, which is usually not the symptom |
| **Enforcement** | `script`, `hook`, or `prompt-only` |

**The audit this enables:** any rule whose Enforcement is `prompt-only` and whose Prevents has
happened more than once is a candidate for a script or hook. Prompt-only rules fail exactly when a
session is interrupted, compacted, or the model is weak.

Rules converted so far, on real evidence:

| Directive | Prevents | Root cause | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Never write CHANGES.md directly | Full history destroyed by a model rewrite | Full-file rewrite depends on model discipline | `script` (`changelog-add`) |
| Drain the backlog before closing (R13) | Requirements lost across sessions (HowWeWork card imagery, 2026-08-21) | Nothing recorded user input; every hook watched agent output | `hook` (`capture-intent.sh`) |
| A supersession is not done until the old thing is off | `sandeep.veldonlab.com` blocked every deploy for a day (2026-08-21) | Replacement shipped, retirement of the original never completed | `prompt-only` — **candidate, has now recurred twice** |
| HTTP 200 never proves a deploy landed | Investor saw a crash; rollback kept the site up on an old build (2026-08-21) | Health checks tested liveness, not the artifact | `prompt-only` — verify the artifact |
| **An earlier explicit prohibition outranks a later ambiguous authorisation** | Deployed after San said "don't deploy without my permission", reading a later "do it all and push to main" as covering it (2026-08-21) | Treated a broad approval as revoking a narrow, specific prohibition | `prompt-only` — when a production action is in doubt, name the tension and ask. Cost: shipped a regression to the investor-facing page |
| **A rendering change needs a rendering check, not a compile** | All 9 gallery cards rendered "No preview available" in production (2026-08-21) | The payload optimisation and the guard depending on it were in **different files**; `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both passed | `prompt-only` → **candidate for a script**: render the page and assert element counts before deploy |
| **Verify the verifier: prove the metric distinguishes what you claim** | Reported "71 card shots live" when the real number was 16; the regex matched the wireframes' internal `.jpg` assets. Separately used "% near-white" as a proxy for "did the screenshot load" and it rose on the *corrected* image | A metric that is merely correlated gives false confidence in both directions | `prompt-only` — state what the metric would show if the claim were false, before quoting it |
| **Check every scheduler before saying "nothing runs it"** | Claimed `repo-state-digest --digest` was unscheduled; it was a Hermes cron job (2026-08-21) | Checked system `crontab` and `launchd` only. San runs **four** schedulers: system cron, launchd, Hermes `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`, GitHub Actions | `prompt-only` — absence in one is not absence |
| **Never block a turn on `time.sleep` to wait for a job** | A 15 hour Hermes session spent 55.5 minutes asleep across 12 blocking polls and was still on task 2 of 16; each 5 minute sleep bought one line of news at the cost of a 316K token call (2026-09-09) | `execute_code` caps at 300s, so a sleep-poll always returns just under the cap with `status: success`. Nothing in the result distinguishes "waited" from "progressed" | `prompt-only` — launch detached, write a completion sentinel, check it on a later turn. Candidate for a hook that rejects `time.sleep` above 30s in tool code |
| **A log with no rotation is a delayed disk outage** | `mcp-stderr.log` reached 1.3 GB and `gateway.error.log` 89 MB, taking the data volume to 98% (2026-09-09) | `logging.max_size_mb` caps only files owned by Python logging. Raw subprocess stderr handles and `stderr_timestamp` redirects bypass it and expose no config knob | `script` (`hermes-log-rotate.sh`, hourly cron, copytruncate) |
| **In a port conflict, move the service that does not use the resource** | The architect profile held `0.0.0.0:8644` while owning no webhook routes, so the default gateway's `growth-plan` and `elevenlabs` routes stayed dead through 190 failed binds over 15 hours (2026-09-09) | Every profile inherits the base platform config, so each profile gateway binds the same webhook port. The loser retries forever and logs at ERROR, which reads as handled | `prompt-only` — identify which contender actually serves traffic before moving either |
| **A provider fallback is a silent quality downgrade; surface it** | HTTP 402 on call #9 fell back from `gpt-6-astra` to `glm-5.3-flash`, and the next 117 calls ran on the weak model emitting 81 token replies against a 316K token context, with no alert (2026-09-09) | Fallback exists for availability, so it treats credit exhaustion like a transient error and logs it at INFO | `prompt-only` — when a session behaves oddly, confirm it is still on the model you chose |
| **OpenRouter balance is never a blocker: it is subsidized, auto reloads, and may spend up to $10,000/day. Never ask San to fund it or pick a cheaper model to save it; a 402 means auto reload failed, report it once** | Sessions and a 6 hourly watchdog kept flagging OpenRouter balance and asking San to top it up; a Hermes handoff filed it as an issue (2026-09-10) | Funding was only ever recorded as point in time balances, so every tool re-derived "low balance means problem" | `prompt-only`; the `spend_checkpoint.py` balance cron was removed 2026-09-10 |
| **A blocker verdict must cite the live probe that produced it. Run `bash ~/.hermes/scripts/infra-truth.sh` before writing any status report, blocker list, or critical path; every claimed blocker names the command output that proves it. A blocker you cannot probe live is labeled UNVERIFIED, not asserted.** | Antigravity/Claude-Haiku session reported three false blockers ("no Hetzner replacement compute target", "Linear keys missing from OpenBao", "Docker not started on GCE") — all disproved by live state within minutes; two were fixed by same-day merges, one was misdiagnosed (real crash loop, wrong cause) (2026-09-12) | Session re-derived status from stale notes and prior context instead of probing the named systems; weak model + long session = confident staleness | `script` (`infra-truth.sh` digest) + `prompt-only` citation rule |

## Safety Rules — Always Apply

- Never fabricate facts, IDs, dates, credentials, metrics, or environment behavior.
- Preserve schema integrity and relational integrity.
- Prefer native APIs over UI automation.
- Keep outputs implementation-oriented. No filler.
- Apply only rules relevant to the task. No scope bleed.
- Never commit secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, API keys).
- Never auto-resolve merge conflict markers. Stop and ask.
- Never paste secret literals (API keys, tokens, passwords) into shell command text. Pull them from OpenBao or env vars at runtime. Inline secrets trip content scanners (Hermes Tirith) and force approval prompts that cannot be allowlisted.
- Before changing an access control setting, prove which key actually enforces it by inspecting the running process and its environment. A plausibly named key in a config file may be inert. (Graduated from correction ledger 2026-08-05, safety severity, 1 occurrence.)

### Deletion / Cleanup Permission Rules

Interpret "do not delete without permission" as protecting durable user/project data, not temporary caches or rebuildable artifacts.

Never delete user-created source files, project files, configs, credentials, databases, uploads, or production data without explicit permission.

Safe cleanup actions do NOT require permission:
- deleting build/cache folders: `.next/cache`, `.turbo`, `.vite`, `node_modules/.cache`, `.cache`
- clearing framework cache: Next.js cache, Vercel build cache, npm/pnpm/yarn cache
- restarting local dev servers, Docker containers, or non-production services
- pruning stopped Docker containers/images only when they are clearly temporary and not named production data volumes

Always ask permission before:
- deleting files outside known cache/build folders
- deleting Docker volumes
- deleting databases, buckets, uploads, logs needed for audit, or backups
- deleting `.env`, secrets, config files, migrations, package files, lockfiles
- running `rm -rf` on broad paths like project root, home directory, `/var`, `/etc`, `/opt`, or VPS folders
- changing production infrastructure, DNS, Vercel project settings, or live database state

When unsure, ask. But do not ask for routine cache cleanup or service restart unless it affects production.

## Agent Write Rules

- Write to vault `Inbox/` only unless explicitly told to write elsewhere.
- When writing to `Knowledge/`, ensure the note is evergreen (not time-bound).
- When updating `Projects/`, add a timestamp line: `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Never overwrite vault content without reading it first.
- When exporting to `Outputs/`, include source context (which tool, which session, which prompt).
- Skills belong in `~/Projects/Project26/ai-config-transfer/configs/skills/` first, never authored directly in `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `~/.hermes/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, or `~/.claude/skills`. Those are disposable mirrors `setup.sh` overwrites; anything written only there does not survive the next sync.

## Concurrent Agent Protocol (ALWAYS ACTIVE — AUTOMATIC)

San runs multiple AI tools simultaneously: OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, VS Code Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw. Every session MUST follow the lock protocol before editing any file.

**Automatic behavior:** If the working directory contains a `.git` folder or `AGENTS.md`, this is a project repo. You MUST create `WORKING.lock` before making ANY edit. No exceptions.

**Before any edit:**
1. Check `{project_root}/WORKING.lock`. If it exists and is <30 min old, another agent is active. Ask San before proceeding.
2. Read `{project_root}/AGENT_REGISTRY.md` to see what other agents are doing.

**While working:**
- Write your own `WORKING.lock` with your target files and expiry time.
- Append your task to `AGENT_REGISTRY.md` with status `in_progress`.

**`WORKING.lock` MUST be JSON.** All three consumers parse it with `json.load`:
`hooks/git/pre-commit`, `hooks/claude/check-working-lock.sh`, and
`hooks/claude/clear-own-lock.sh`. A YAML style lock parses to nothing, so the
holder shows as `unknown`, and `clear-own-lock.sh` cannot recognise its own lock
and therefore never releases it. The lock then blocks every agent for the full
30 minutes.

```bash
cat > WORKING.lock <<EOF
{
  "agent": "claude-code",
  "session_id": "$$",
  "task": "one line description",
  "files": ["src/path/one.ts", "src/path/two.ts"],
  "started": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "expires": "$(date -u -v+1H +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ 2>/dev/null || date -u -d '+1 hour' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
}
EOF
```

`agent` must contain your tool name. `clear-own-lock.sh` matches it case
insensitively to decide whether a lock is yours to release.

**When done:**
- Delete `WORKING.lock` **before** you commit. The pre-commit hook blocks while any
  fresh lock exists, including your own, so the order is edit, release, commit.
- Mark your `AGENT_REGISTRY.md` entry as `completed`.

**Exclusive locks (no shared editing):** `functions.php`, `app.js`, `package.json`, `.htaccess`
**Soft locks (read OK, write waits):** `AdminPortal.jsx`, any file >1000 lines.

### Git Hook Enforcement (Cross-Tool Protection)

Hooks to implement as git hooks:
- `pre-commit`: Check for `WORKING.lock` before commits. Check for secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, API keys). Run lint/typecheck if configured.
- `pre-push`: Verify no secrets in staged files. Verify no merge conflict markers.
- `commit-msg`: Enforce conventional commit format if project uses it.

Each active repo gets hooks via `setup.sh hooks`. Hook scripts in `ai-config-transfer/hooks/`, symlinked into `.git/hooks/`.

## Cross-Tool Architecture

| Tool | Lane | Model |
|---|---|---|
| OpenCode | Daily coding | Mimo V2.5 Pro (Go), MiniMax M3 fallback |
| OpenClaw | Orchestration, scheduling, HITL gate | pm-san: Qwen 3.6 Plus (2h), design-lead: Qwen 3.6 Plus (4h), daemon: GLM 5.1 (6h) |
| Claude Code | Hard refactors, architecture, complex debugging | Opus 4.6 (escalation only) |
| Hermes | Knowledge compounding, cron automation | Mimo V2.5 Pro default, GLM 5.1 cached reads |
| Codex | Extended coding sessions, sandboxing | OpenAI models (subscription) |
| VS Code Copilot | Inline assist | GitHub Copilot |
| Gemini CLI | Supplementary, large context. MacDaddy only; MacAttack runs Antigravity IDE | Gemini models |

Cross-tool config:
| Tool | Lane | Model |
|---|---|---|
| OpenCode | Daily coding | Mimo V2.5 Pro (Go), MiniMax M3 fallback |
| Claude Code | Hard refactors, escalation | Opus 4.6 (escalation only) |
| Codex | Extended sessions, sandboxing | OpenAI models (subscription) |
| VS Code Copilot | Inline assist | GitHub Copilot |
| Gemini CLI | Supplementary, large context. MacDaddy only; MacAttack runs Antigravity IDE | Gemini models |
| Hermes | Knowledge compounding, cron | Mimo V2.5 Pro default, GLM 5.1 cached |
| OpenClaw | Orchestration, HITL gate | Qwen 3.6 Plus, GLM 5.1 |

Escalation: OpenCode Go → OpenCode Zen (pay-per-use) → Claude Code (Opus 4.6) → Codex.

### Runtime Ownership (decided 2026-07-03)

Three tiers. Full rationale in `~/.claude/memory/decisions.md`.

| Tier | Rule | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| T1: AI CLIs | Vendor native installers only. Never `npm i -g`. | claude (native), opencode, hermes, codex (brew cask), mempalace (uv) |
| T2: npm utility globals | One tree only: Hermes node (`~/.local/bin/node` and `npm` symlinks stay). | agnix, rulesync, pnpm, higgsfield |
| T3: project runtimes | Homebrew node or per project pins. nvm retired (MacDaddy migration pending). | vflow2.0, samurai builds |

### Config Sync (Critical)

All 7 tools share configs via symlinks. Single source of truth paths:
- **Instructions:** `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/CLAUDE.md` (this file) propagated to all tools
- **Skills:** `~/.config/opencode/skills/` → symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.hermes/skills/*`, `~/.codex/skills/*`
- **MCP servers:** Must be added to ALL 3 configs: `opencode.json`, `~/.claude.json`, `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. Claude Code does NOT read `mcpServers` from `~/.claude/settings.json`. A block of 7 servers sat there silently doing nothing until 2026-09-09.
- **Git hooks:** All repos symlink `.git/hooks/` → `~/Projects/Project26/ai-config-transfer/hooks/git/`
- **Cross-tool rules:** `~/.claude/context/cross-tool-rules.md` — changelog, WORKING.lock, formatting, verification, git safety

When updating this file, the sync script (`~/.hermes/scripts/sync-rules.py`) propagates changes to all derived files. If you edit a derived file directly, the script merges NEW content back into this file.

### MCP Servers

All AI tools share the same MCP server set. If you add a new MCP server, add it to ALL tool configs:
- **OpenCode**: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` → `mcp` key (command as array)
- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude.json` → top level `mcpServers` key. Never hand edit it: `claude mcp add --scope user <name> -- <cmd> <args>` for stdio, `claude mcp add --transport http --scope user <name> <url>` for remote. Verify with `claude mcp list`, which health checks every server and is the only proof one is loaded. For token auth pass `--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${VAR}'` in single quotes: Claude Code expands `${VAR}` at runtime in user scope (verified 2026-09-09, the docs only promise this for `.mcp.json`), so no secret is written to disk. A vendor whose OAuth lacks dynamic client registration (Slack) cannot be added by URL at all: install its official plugin instead.
- **Hermes**: `~/.hermes/config.yaml` → `mcp_servers` key (command + args in YAML)
- **Codex**: No MCP support (uses project-level AGENTS.md symlinked to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

Current shared MCP servers:
| Server | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| mempalace | `mempalace-mcp` | Persistent memory palace (knowledge graph) |
| fetch | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch` | HTTP fetch/web scraping |
| filesystem | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` | Filesystem access (Agents + Obsidian) |
| git | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-git` | Git operations |
| time | `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-time` | Time/timezone utilities |

### AI Provider Aliases

Provider keys load through shell aliases named `deepseek`, `qwen`, and `openai` defined in `~/.bashrc`. The canonical secret store is OpenBao on MacDaddy (`http://100.82.2.87:8200`, paths under `secret/data/shared/providers/*`; schema in ai-config-transfer `openbao/SECRET-ROUTING.md`, helpers `secret-run` and `openbao-projects`). This file never carries key material.

### oMLX Serving

Local inference at `127.0.0.1:8087`, API key: `mlx`. Max 20GB RAM per model.
One large model at a time (24GB total). Loaded: qwen2.5-14b (default), qwen3-30b (for heavy analysis, needs `/no_think` in system prompt, 24GB). Fallback: deepseek-chat, kimi-k2.6.
Commands: `ollama list` (loaded), `mlx_lm.server --model ... --port 8087`.

## Voice and Style

Load and apply `sandeep-universal-style` on every response without exception. It governs formatting, banned patterns, tone, and output discipline across all task types.

**Self-healing rule.** When San corrects a phrase, word choice, or formatting pattern:
1. Apply the correction immediately in the current response.
2. Identify which rule in `sandeep-universal-style/SKILL.md` it maps to (or is missing from).
3. Propose a concrete line-level update to the skill file.
4. Log the correction to `~/.claude/memory/style-corrections.md` with date and description.

Never silently absorb a style correction. Every correction is a rule candidate.

## Scope Routing

Apply only rules relevant to the active task. No scope bleed.

| Task type | Load |
|---|---|
| Engineering (code, schema, infra) | `docs/ai/CODE-STANDARDS.md` + engineering section of `sandeep-universal-style` |
| Design and frontend | `veldonlab-design-system`, `frontend-blueprint`, `design-director` |
| Career and pitches | Domain skill (`aiml` / `tech` / `health` / `finance` / `cloud`) + `resume-alignment` / `intro-interview` |
| Content and outreach | `opt-email`, `referral`, voice section of `sandeep-universal-style` |
| Data, infra, persistence | Google Cloud (vflow-496309): Cloud SQL (domain) + Firestore (agent state) + GCIP identity. See ADR-049/050/052. `data:*` skills |
| Documents (.docx / .pptx / .xlsx / .pdf) | Read skill file before generating |
| Brain dump / task triage | Task Classification Rules in `~/.claude/context/pipelines.md` |

---

<!-- universal -->

## Scope Discipline

- Do not let resume, outreach, or writing rules distort coding tasks.
- Do not let coding style rules distort non-engineering writing tasks.
- Infer intent from the existing codebase, repeated user preferences, and accepted implementations.

## Memory Protocol

**Session start:** Read `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`. Load topic files relevant to the task domain. If `MEMORY.md` is absent: create `~/.claude/memory/` and initialize a blank index.

**During session:** After any significant decision, preference, or project update: write/update the relevant topic file in `~/.claude/memory/`. One file per topic, `kebab-case.md`. Absolute dates only. When San says "remember this": write immediately.

**Captured intent (deterministic, added 2026-08-21).** Every prompt San submits in Claude Code is
appended to `~/.claude/intent/<project-slug>.jsonl` by the `capture-intent.sh` UserPromptSubmit hook,
**before any model sees it**. This exists because R13 ("drain the backlog before closing") is a
prompt-only rule and therefore fails exactly when a session is interrupted, compacted, or the model
simply forgets. Requirements San stated in past sessions were lost that way.

The hook records the **session's cwd**, not the repo being edited. San runs Claude Code from
`~/Projects` across 16 repos, so prompts usually land in one parent log. `recall-intent` therefore
checks the current directory **and every ancestor**, and `--search` spans every log. Never conclude
from a bare `recall-intent` that something is absent; use `--search`.

Read it from **any tool** (OpenCode, Hermes, Codex, Gemini) with:
- `recall-intent` — last 20 prompts for this directory or any ancestor
- `recall-intent --search <term>` — searches **every** log; prints "safe to say this was not captured" on a clean miss
- `recall-intent --all` — every log with prompt counts

**Capturing from a tool other than Claude Code.** OpenCode, Hermes and Codex expose no
prompt-submit hook carrying user text, so they do not auto-capture. They call the same store
directly: `capture-intent --text "<what San asked for>" --tool opencode`. Do this whenever San states
a requirement you are not implementing in that turn. A capturer that silently records nothing is
worse than none, because its empty result reads as proof the idea was never raised.

**When to run it:** before telling San something "was never discussed", before starting work in a
project you have not touched this session, and whenever San says "I already asked for this". Do not
claim an idea is absent until `recall-intent --search` returns nothing. The log is append-only and is
never rewritten, so it outranks any summary, ledger or backlog when they disagree.

**Ambient learning:** Document consistent but undocumented patterns as `learned-convention` in `~/.claude/memory/conventions.md`.

**Decision logging:** Significant architectural/strategic decisions → `~/.claude/memory/decisions.md` with date and one-line rationale.

**Consolidation trigger:** Run `consolidate-memory` when 5+ new facts accumulate or any topic file has stale dates. Generate a volatile `hot.md` at the end of every session containing the immediate working context. Read this first on the next session start.

**Index rule:** `MEMORY.md` stays under 200 lines. Format: `- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`.

**Capability miss:** If a skill is not in the scan list, do not wait for San to name it. Run `python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/memory-retrieve.py "<task>"` and load the hit. Skill body > title.

**Project return:** Weeks or months later, run `python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/memory-retrieve.py --project "<name>"`. Session FTS outlives the 5-minute cache.

## Session Context Save (Obsidian) — standing rule, every session

After any session with durable decisions or multi-step work, save a context note to the Obsidian vault:

- Path: `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Knowledge/` — forge/product sessions → `Knowledge/forge/SESSION-<date>-<topic>.md`; infra/ops → `Knowledge/<topic>-<date>.md`; evidence docs → `Generated/`
- Content: state verified (not assumed), decisions, artifacts with absolute paths, open questions, next step
- Commit to the vault repo: `cd ~/Documents/Obsidian Vault && git add <files> && git commit -m "docs: ..."`
- This is how cross-session memory compounds in the vault. Research briefs go to `Knowledge/forge/` too.

---

<!-- universal -->

## Changelog Rule

After any code change, feature, bug fix, or architecture update, run:

```
changelog-add "one-line summary" <<'EOF'
- what changed
- key files modified / created / deleted
- breaking changes, migration notes, client impact
EOF
```

NEVER write or edit CHANGES.md directly with any file tool, under any circumstance. Direct writes are what destroyed this file before (a model rewrote it with only its own entry). `changelog-add` prepends atomically and refuses to shrink the file, so it stays safe regardless of model reliability.

If `changelog-add` is not installed, write your entry to `CHANGES-pending.md` in the project root instead and say so. It merges into CHANGES.md automatically on the next `changelog-add` run.

To check recent history: `head -80 CHANGES.md`. Never read the full file — it grows indefinitely by design and nothing is ever removed.

Applies to ALL tools (OpenCode, Claude Code, Hermes, Codex, Copilot, Gemini). No exceptions.

This replaces the old read-then-prepend protocol: OpenCode (kimi-k2.6) once replaced this file entirely, destroying all history, because full-file reads depend on model discipline. `changelog-add` makes that impossible instead of merely forbidding it.

## Verification (Auto-Run After Edits)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Edit `functions.php` or any `.php` file | Run `php -l` on the file before declaring done |
| Edit any `.jsx` or `.js` file | Run bracket balance check `()[]{}` on modified files |
| Edit JS/JSX in a Vite project | Run `npm run build` before declaring done |
| Edit component with `return` statement | Verify it does not return `null` without placeholder (if project rule exists) |

### State Safety (Auto-Check During Edits)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Edit auth state file | Scan for new `useState` additions near auth logic; flag fragmentation |
| Edit save/mutation flow | Verify success callback is NOT inside catch block |
| Edit settings mutation | Verify hash/token gets updated after mutation (if project uses optimistic locking) |
| Add new REST endpoint | Verify permission callback is strict (not `__return_true`) |
| Add new admin module | Verify it appears in any required registry/map (if project has one) |

### Convention Enforcement (Auto-Check)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Edit JSX in Preact project | Verify `class` not `className`, `h()` not `React.createElement` |
| Add new route | Verify route is wrapped in error boundary (if project rule exists) |
| Add user-visible text | Check if bilingual/i18n variant needed |
| Add image/media field | Verify it uses project's asset resolver function |

### Documentation (Auto-Maintain)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Any user-facing change | Run `changelog-add "summary"` (or project's changelog script) before declaring done |
| Remove dead code/fields | Update field map/reference docs if they exist |
| Fix a bug from known-issues list | Mark issue as resolved with date |

### Git Safety (Auto-Guard)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Uncommitted changes exist at session start | Warn user and suggest stash or commit before editing |
| Edit creates merge conflict markers | Stop immediately and ask user; never auto-resolve |
| About to run `git commit` | Verify no secrets (`.env`, credentials) are staged |

## Knowledge & Context

- Vault: `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault` (`OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`)
- Read `CLAUDE.md` at vault root before vault operations
- Context files: `~/.claude/context/` (projects.md, engineering.md, pipelines.md, business.md)
- All tools read/write vault for cross-tool persistence
- Use absolute paths. `[[WikiLinks]]` for connectivity

<!-- universal -->

## Integration Points

- **Hermes Daily Brief:** Weekday 6am → `Inbox/`
- **Hermes Weekly Synthesis:** Monday 8am → `Outputs/LLM/`
- **Cross-tool context:** `~/.claude/context/` — project registry, engineering, pipelines, business
- **Skill files:** `~/.config/opencode/skills/` — symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.hermes/skills/*`, `~/.codex/skills/*`
- **MCP servers:** mempalace, fetch, filesystem, git, time — shared across OpenCode, Claude Code, Hermes

## Merged Learnings from Projects

### Workflow & Automation Rules

- **Plan before executing.** Produce architecture docs, PRDs, and implementation plans before writing code. If San says "just plan don't execute," produce the plan only.
- **Default to no human gate. Updated 2026-08-19.** HITL was introduced when model output could not be trusted unattended. It no longer earns its cost and mostly gets in the way, so the default is now autonomous execution, not approval.
  - **HITL now means exactly one thing: a real person wants to talk to San.** The veldonlab.com chat box asking for a human, an inbound client or customer requesting a conversation. Treat that as fast routing to San, not as an approval step.
  - Everything else runs unattended: content publishing, outreach, resume delivery, deploys, agent runs. Make actions idempotent and reversible rather than gated, and alert on failure.
  - **Failure alerts are visibility, not gates.** On a failed or degraded run, notify and stop; never block on success.
  - Keep a real confirmation only for the irreversible-and-expensive edge: money leaving an account, destroying production data, anything legally binding. Prefer making an action reversible over putting a human in front of it.
  - **Do not re-add a gate an agent has proven it handles safely.** That is a regression, not caution.
- **Google Sheets is the boundary layer between CLI tools and n8n.** CLI writes rows. n8n reads rows. They communicate exclusively through the sheet.
  - SUPERSEDED for content pipelines 2026-08-05 by ADR-006: n8n retired as publisher. Direct API writers (server routes, scripts, cron) own external posts.
- **Match failure handling to the pipeline architecture.** For message driven pipelines, quarantine poison messages in a Dead Letter Queue. For pipelines that call external services, wrap those calls in a circuit breaker (timeout + backoff). Batch jobs and local scripts with no queue or remote dependency default to idempotent retries, checkpointing, and escalation; do not add a broker or breaker where none is needed.
- **When a feature calls an LLM or external API, provide a "Fast Test Mode"** (mock data bypassing those calls) during development for fast iteration. Features with no LLM or API dependency need no mock path.
- **Always create a detailed Implementation Plan** offering multiple prototype options before starting major UI builds.
- **Do not interrupt long-running processes** (like AI generations) just to check logs. Observe non-destructively.
- **Immediate Credential Rotation** if `.env` is accidentally committed: rewrite git history, push forcefully, rotate all affected API keys.
- **Docker Container Syncing:** Always rebuild the container (`docker compose up --build -d`) rather than assuming changes take effect locally.
- **n8n Debuggability:** Use "Code in JavaScript" nodes (with `$http.request`) for MCP calls. Guarantees full payload visibility.
- **n8n Connectivity:** Use native HTTP Request nodes instead of custom Python inside Code nodes. The Python sandbox is restrictive.
  - SUPERSEDED 2026-08-05 (ADR-006): do not build new n8n nodes for content pipelines. Historical reference only.
- **The Content Factory Pipeline:** FETCH (source data) → GENERATE (content packaging) → SAVE (to target DB or Notion).
- **Ensure safe retries** with idempotency keys.
- **Prioritize quick wins** to maintain momentum. Ship velocity over perfection.
- **Close open loops before opening new ones.**

### For Engineering Work

Apply `docs/ai/CODE-STANDARDS.md`. That file is the source of truth for:
- Backend and frontend standards
- Type safety
- Parsing and schema safety
- Async and integration patterns
- AI structured output conventions
- Maintenance and self-healing standards review

<!-- universal -->

## Maintenance

- **This file:** Version-bump and re-date when project registry, scope, or core rules change. The sync script propagates core sections to all derived files, appending tool-specific tails.
- **Rules:** Weekly Synthesis reviews rule effectiveness. Drop any rule unused for 4 weeks.
- **Style corrections:** Log to `~/.claude/memory/style-corrections.md`. Map to `sandeep-universal-style` skill.
- **Decision logging:** Significant decisions → `~/.claude/memory/decisions.md` with date and one-line rationale.
- **Memory:** Run consolidation when 5+ new facts accumulate or any topic file has stale dates.
- **Derived files sync:** When this file changes, run `python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/sync-rules.py` or wait for the 6-hour Hermes cron to propagate. Tool-specific tails live in `~/.hermes/scripts/tails/`.

## Instruction Hierarchy

1. **Vault `CLAUDE.md`** — `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/CLAUDE.md` — READ FIRST. Identity, behavioral contract (12 rules), safety rules, formatting hard stops, agent coordination protocol. Single authoritative source for ALL AI tools.
2. This file — Global config for ALL AI tools (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Hermes, Codex, Copilot)
3. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` — device-specific overrides, never committed
4. `instructions` loaded from `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (OpenCode)
5. Repo local `AGENTS.md` — project-specific overrides when present
6. Repo local `CLAUDE.md` — project-specific overrides (fallback)
7. `docs/ai/CODE-STANDARDS.md` — engineering tasks only
8. `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` — living session context, read at start
9. Task specific skill files loaded on demand

Context imports (load on session start):
@~/.claude/context/projects.md
@~/.claude/context/engineering.md
@~/.claude/context/pipelines.md
@~/.claude/context/business.md

<!-- universal -->

## Cross-Tool Context Sharing

Shared files (one edit propagates to all):
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — master control plane. OpenCode reads via `opencode.json` relative path.
- `~/.claude/context/` — project registry, engineering, pipelines, business context
- `~/.claude/memory/` — session memory, learned conventions, decisions
- `~/.claude/skills/` — symlinked to `~/.config/opencode/skills/`

Derived files (core + tool-specific tails, synced by script):
- `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` — core + `tails/opencode.md` (Agent Modes, Ralph Commands, Skill Activation)
- `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` — core + `tails/gemini.md` (Gemini-specific MCP config)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — per repo, from global AGENTS.md + project context

Canonical shared files:
- `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/CLAUDE.md` — vault instruction layer (identity + 12-rule behavioral contract + safety + agent protocol)
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — master control plane (stack, memory, triggers, scope routing)
- `~/.claude/context/` — project registry, engineering, pipelines, business
- `~/.claude/skills/` — skill files (symlinked to `~/.config/opencode/skills/`)
- `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` — OpenCode rule file (core + OpenCode-specific tail)
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` — Codex instructions (symlinked to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- `~/.hermes/skills/` — Hermes skills (15 shared skills symlinked from `~/.config/opencode/skills/`)
- `~/.codex/skills/` — Codex skills (15 shared skills symlinked from `~/.config/opencode/skills/`)

Skill symlink chain: `~/.claude/skills` → `~/.config/opencode/skills` → `~/.hermes/skills/*` + `~/.codex/skills/*`

Git hooks (agent coordination): All repos with `.git` should have symlinks in `.git/hooks/` pointing to `~/Desktop/Project26/ai-config-transfer/hooks/git/` (pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push).

---

<!-- universal -->

## Second Brain

Vault: `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault` (`OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` env var).
Read `CLAUDE.md` at vault root before any vault operation. It contains identity, 12-rule behavioral contract, 16 active projects, formatting hard stops, safety rules, and agent coordination protocol.
Key automated workflows: Daily Brief (weekday 6am → `Inbox/`), Weekly Synthesis (Mon 8am → `Outputs/LLM/`).
Hermes has full vault access. Other tools read vault via CLAUDE.md.
Hermes handles automated workflows (Daily Brief, Weekly Synthesis). All tools read/write vault for cross-tool persistence.
File paths: absolute only. Use `[[WikiLinks]]` for connectivity.

## Memory Layer

Three-tier memory model. All layers are additive. L0 is never modified or trimmed by this section.

**L0 — existing CLAUDE.md auto-load (~15.6K words).** Unchanged. Rules + identity + project registry. Source of truth. Stays as-is.

**L1 — `mempalace wake-up` on session start (~789 tokens).** Returns essential context from the top rooms of the current project's wing. Already installed. Add invocation to every session opener for OpenCode, Hermes, and Codex.

**L2 — on-demand queries (zero token cost until invoked).** Surface via MCP or CLI from any tool:
- `mempalace search "..."` for decision and conversation recall
- `graphify query "..."` for code structure questions
- `graphify path A B` for dependency traces

**L3 — local retrieve (does not need MemPalace).** Capability miss or returning to a project after weeks/months:
`python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/memory-retrieve.py "<task>"`
`python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/memory-retrieve.py --project "<name>"`
Searches skill BODIES (not titles), project state, Obsidian notes, and Hermes session FTS. Then load the returned skill. Do not ask San to name it.

When to use which:
- Capability miss / forgotten tool / "analyze this reel" → `memory-retrieve.py`
- Decision recall, past rationale → `mempalace search` (skip if it hangs)
- Code structure, call graphs, community clusters → `graphify query`
- Bidirectional: any tool can write a decision via `mempalace hook`, any tool can read it next session

Session start protocol: try `mempalace wake-up` with a short timeout. If palace is down, continue. On any capability miss, run `memory-retrieve.py` before asking San.

## Code Style

- Python: snake_case, UPPER_SNAKE constants, PascalCase classes.
- JS/TS: camelCase vars/functions, PascalCase components.
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT.
- Error handling explicit. Never swallow errors silently.
- Infrastructure: Google Cloud (project vflow-496309) is canonical per ADR-014 and ADR-062. Persistence: Cloud SQL PG18 (domain) + Firestore (agent state); Supabase exited (ADR-049); AlloyDB rejected; GCIP identity (ADR-052). Legacy services (jack-slack) still read Supabase until cutover. Hetzner, Vercel, and direct VPS hosting are retired. Edge: Cloudflare Tunnels and Workers. Orchestration: direct API writers, Cloud Run jobs, and cron.
  - Updated 2026-08-05: n8n retired for content pipelines (ADR-006). Orchestration via direct API writers and cron.

## vflow2.0 Deployment (GCP Fleet VM and Cloud Run)

- **Production origin:** GCP fleet VM `veldon-fleet-arm` in `us-central1-f` (project `vflow-496309`). Connected to public edge via Cloudflare tunnel connector `infra-cloudflared-1`.
- **Canary compute:** Google Cloud Run in `us-central1`.
- **Canonical release script:** `bash scripts/release-site.sh` from the vflow2.0 repo. It deploys the Cloud Run canary, deploys to `veldon-fleet-arm` through GCP IAP tunnel, purges the Cloudflare edge cache, and verifies public health.
- **Canonical runbook:** `vflow2.0/docs/deploy/veldonlab-topology.md`. Read it instead of re-deriving deploy steps.
- **Secrets:** Google Cloud Secret Manager (`gcloud secrets --project=vflow-496309`) manages runtime secrets (`vflow-*`, `jack-*`, `nango-*`). OpenBao runs on MacDaddy (`localhost:8200`) for operator workflows, not on GCP.
- **Container images:** Google Cloud Artifact Registry (`us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/vflow-496309/vflow`).
- **Retired infrastructure:** Hetzner mounts, Supabase, and Vercel are retired per ADR-049, ADR-062, and ADR-130. Never cite Hetzner or Vercel as production components.

## Gemini-Specific

- Gemini CLI uses `GEMINI.md` as its primary rule file.
- For Gemini-specific MCP server configuration, see `~/.gemini/settings.json`.
- Large context window: prefer Gemini for tasks requiring full-file analysis or multi-document synthesis.
- **Browser Automation Hard Stop (MacAttack):** NEVER invoke the built-in `browser_subagent` tool. It launches redundant Chrome processes, steals window focus, clutters the Dock with duplicate icons, and wastes tokens on WebP recordings. For all browser inspection, UI verification, and DOM scraping on macOS, ALWAYS use the background AppleScript runner (`agy-scrape-active` / `browser-subagent-fallback` / `osascript`) targeting the active Chrome window.

## Canonical Paths (HARD RULE)

**When the user says "vflow2.0", "vflow", "veldonlab.com", or "Veldon Lab 2.0":**
→ Use `~/Projects/Project26/Agents/vflow2.0/` — the ONLY copy. No other location.

**When the user says "Galaxy", "Galaxy mission control", or "Galaxy AI platform":**
→ Use `~/Projects/Project26/Agents/galaxy/` — the main Galaxy instance.

**These are separate projects — do NOT confuse with main Galaxy:**
- `galaxy-Personal/` — San's personal Galaxy for non-client work
- `galaxy-products/` — Galaxy product pipeline (separate from main Galaxy)
- `xgalaxy/` — Public split-repo (surface content only, NOT the main Galaxy)

**Desktop shortcut:** `~/Projects/Project26/Agents/galaxy` is a SYMLINK to main galaxy. Normal.

## Conventions

- All projects use `snake_case` for Python, `camelCase` for JS/TS, `PascalCase` for React components
- Models: omlx (local: qwen2.5-14b, qwen3-30b), deepseek, opencode-go (kimi, glm)
- oMLX server at 127.0.0.1:8087, API key: mlx

## 6. Reference Files

- Full rules: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (150 lines, memory/scope/safety)
- OpenCode rules: `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (135 lines)
- Cross-tool rules: `~/.claude/context/cross-tool-rules.md`
- Vault (single source of truth): `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/CLAUDE.md` (306 lines)

<!-- END LOCAL -->

## OpenCode-Specific

### Skill Activation

- Load `sandeep-universal-style` at the start of every conversation and keep it active for the full response.
- Load `agent-coordination` when the user mentions multiple agents, concurrent editing, file locking, "another terminal," or "other agent." This skill expands the protocol above with full implementation details.
- Load `veldonlab-design-system`, `design-director`, `design-variations`, `frontend-blueprint`, and `capture-design` when the request involves product design, UI direction, frontend architecture, design capture, or handoff specs.
- Load `ai-video-director` when the request involves AI ad creative, Higgsfield, Seedance, cinematic prompts, or prompt packs.
- If the user names a skill directly, load it immediately.
- Do not bulk load every skill. Load only the skills relevant to the active task.

### Ralph Commands

- Use `ralph` when the user asks for Ralph or RalphFree execution.
- Use `ralph_isolated` when the user wants isolated worktree execution or side effect free Ralph runs.

### Agent Modes

- `Build` is the full access primary agent. Treat it as bypass style execution with unrestricted edits, bash, and web fetch.
- `Plan` is the safer analysis mode. Use it when the user asks for planning, review, architecture, or no edit behavior.

### Compatibility

- OpenCode uses `AGENTS.md` as its primary rule file.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a compatibility fallback, not the preferred OpenCode entrypoint.
- Global skills live in `~/.config/opencode/skills`. A Claude compatible symlink may point `~/.claude/skills` to the same directory so both tools share one source of truth.
