# Cross-Tool Rules (Shared by ALL AI tools)

## 1. Changelog Rule

After any code change, feature, bug fix, or architecture update, you MUST:
1. Ensure `CHANGES.md` exists in the project root
2. Add a new entry at the very top using this format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (UTC) — one-line summary

**Changes:**
- What changed
- Key files modified / created / deleted
- Breaking changes, migration notes, client impact
```

Applies to ALL tools (OpenCode, Claude Code, Hermes, Codex, Copilot, Gemini). No exceptions.

---

<!-- universal -->

## 2. Agent Coordination (Concurrent Editing)

San runs multiple AI tools simultaneously. Before editing ANY file:
1. Check `{project_root}/WORKING.lock`. If it exists and is <30 min old, ask San before proceeding.
2. Read `{project_root}/AGENT_REGISTRY.md` to see what other agents are doing.
3. While working: write your own `WORKING.lock` with target files and expiry.
4. When done: delete `WORKING.lock`. Mark `AGENT_REGISTRY.md` entry as `completed`.

## 3. Formatting Hard Stops

- No em dashes. Use colon, period, or comma.
- No filler adverbs: "seamlessly", "effortlessly", "robustly", "leveraging", "utilizing".
- No preamble. Lead with the deliverable.
- Active voice only. No "it should be noted that."
- Code: `snake_case` (Python), `camelCase` (JS/TS), `PascalCase` (React components).

## 4. Verification (Auto-Run After Edits)

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Edit `.php` | Run `php -l` on file |
| Edit `.jsx`/`.js` | Check bracket balance |
| Edit JS/JSX in Vite project | Run `npm run build` before done |
| About to `git commit` | Verify no secrets staged |

## 5. Skill Activation

- Load `sandeep-universal-style` at conversation start.
- Load named skills only when relevant to the task.
- Do not bulk load every skill.

## 6. Reference Files

- Full rules: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (150 lines, memory/scope/safety)
- OpenCode rules: `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` (135 lines)
- Cross-tool rules: `~/.claude/context/cross-tool-rules.md`
- Vault (single source of truth): `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/CLAUDE.md` (306 lines)

## What I Want From AI Tools

1. **Surface connections I haven't seen.** Find links between projects, ideas, and notes.
2. **Challenge my assumptions.** Don't agree with me — find the gap in my thinking.
3. **When I ask what to focus on** — answer from vault context, not generically.
4. **Flag contradictions.** If something I saved earlier contradicts something new, call it out.
5. **Be concise.** No preamble. No fluff. Direct answers. Tables over paragraphs.
6. **Save durable insights.** Update this vault. Compound the knowledge.

## Behavioral Contract — 12 Rules

> Each rule prevents a specific observed failure mode. Source: Forrest Chang's 6-week, 30-codebase study built on Karpathy's January 2026 thread. Compliance holds ~76% for 12 rules; past 14 rules drops to 52%.
> **Any rule that hasn't prevented a real failure in 4 weeks gets dropped.** This is a living contract, not a museum.

### Before Writing Code
| # | Rule | Prevents |
|---|------|----------|
| R1 | **State assumptions explicitly.** If uncertain, ask. Stop when confused. Name what's unclear. | Silent wrong assumptions |
| R2 | **Read before writing.** Before adding code, read exports, callers, shared utilities. | Code conflicts 30 lines away |
| R3 | **Minimum code that solves the problem.** Nothing speculative. No abstractions for single-use code. Would a senior engineer call it overcomplicated? Simplify. | Over-engineering |

### While Writing Code
| # | Rule | Prevents |
|---|------|----------|
| R4 | **Touch only what you must.** Don't refactor adjacent code. Match existing style. Clean up only your own mess. | Orthogonal damage |
| R5 | **Model only for judgment calls.** Use for: classification, drafting, summarization. NOT for: routing, retries, deterministic transforms. If code can answer, code answers. | Flaky AI-driven business logic |
| R6 | **Match conventions, even if you disagree.** snake_case → snake_case. class components → class components. If you think the convention is harmful, surface it — don't fork silently. | Convention drift across 16 projects |
| R7 | **Surface conflicts, don't average them.** If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent/tested). Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup. | Incoherent blended code |

### Verifying Work
| # | Rule | Prevents |
|---|------|----------|
| R8 | **Define success, then iterate.** Don't follow steps. Define what done looks like and loop until verified. | Aimless iteration |
| R9 | **Tests verify intent, not just behavior.** A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong. | Shallow tests passing while production breaks |
| R10 | **Fail loud.** "Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently. "Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped. Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it. | Silent failures compounding across 7 tools |

### Session Management
| # | Rule | Prevents |
|---|------|----------|
| R11 | **Hard token budgets.** Per-task: 4,000 tokens. Per-session: 30,000 tokens. Summarize and start fresh when approaching the limit. Surface the breach. | Agent spirals, 90-minute loops |
| R12 | **Checkpoint every significant step.** Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left. Don't continue from a state you can't describe back. If you lose track, stop and restate. | Multi-step refactors losing state |

### Exceptions
- **Prototypes / spikes:** R3 and R9 are relaxed — speculative code and shallow tests are acceptable.
- **Single-file scripts:** R2, R4, and R10 are relaxed.
- **Trivial tasks:** R1 and R12 are relaxed.

### Rule Expiration — 4-Week Auto-Prune
After each Weekly Synthesis (Monday 8am), Hermes reviews the 12 rules against the vault's work log:
- **If a rule prevented zero real failures in 4 weeks** → flag for removal.
- **If a new failure mode appears** → propose a new rule.
- Target: stay at 10-14 rules. Add one → drop one.
- **Failure tracking:** `Knowledge/rules-fired.md` — `YYYY-MM-DD | R# | what the rule prevented`.

## Formatting Hard Stops

These apply to ALL output across ALL tools. No exceptions.

- No em dashes. Restructure the sentence.
- No hyphens in compound modifiers (write "real time" not "real-time").
- No filler adverbs: "really", "truly", "incredibly", "genuinely".
- No bullet lists in final deliverables (emails, letters, pitch scripts) unless explicitly requested.
- No preamble before a deliverable. Output first.
- No post-summary after a deliverable. End at the last line.
- One clarifying question max per response.
- Active voice in all operational and instructional writing.
- End every response with a concrete next step or ask. Never end with "let me know if you need anything."

---

---

## Safety Rules — Always Apply

- Never fabricate facts, IDs, dates, credentials, metrics, or environment behavior.
- Preserve schema integrity and relational integrity.
- Prefer native APIs over UI automation.
- Keep outputs implementation-oriented. No filler.
- Apply only rules relevant to the task. No scope bleed.
- Never commit secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, API keys).
- Never auto-resolve merge conflict markers. Stop and ask.

---

---

## Agent Write Rules

- Write to vault `Inbox/` only unless explicitly told to write elsewhere.
- When writing to `Knowledge/`, ensure the note is evergreen (not time-bound).
- When updating `Projects/`, add a timestamp line: `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Never overwrite vault content without reading it first.
- When exporting to `Outputs/`, include source context (which tool, which session, which prompt).

---

---

## Concurrent Agent Protocol (ALWAYS ACTIVE — AUTOMATIC)

San runs multiple AI tools simultaneously: OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, VS Code Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw. Every session MUST follow the lock protocol before editing any file.

**Automatic behavior:** If the working directory contains a `.git` folder or `AGENTS.md`, this is a project repo. You MUST create `WORKING.lock` before making ANY edit. No exceptions.

**Before any edit:**
1. Check `{project_root}/WORKING.lock`. If it exists and is <30 min old, another agent is active. Ask San before proceeding.
2. Read `{project_root}/AGENT_REGISTRY.md` to see what other agents are doing.

**While working:**
- Write your own `WORKING.lock` with your target files and expiry time.
- Append your task to `AGENT_REGISTRY.md` with status `in_progress`.

**When done:**
- Delete `WORKING.lock`.
- Mark your `AGENT_REGISTRY.md` entry as `completed`.

**Exclusive locks (no shared editing):** `functions.php`, `app.js`, `package.json`, `.htaccess`
**Soft locks (read OK, write waits):** `AdminPortal.jsx`, any file >1000 lines.

### Git Hook Enforcement (Cross-Tool Protection)

Hooks to implement as git hooks:
- `pre-commit`: Check for `WORKING.lock` before commits. Check for secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, API keys). Run lint/typecheck if configured.
- `pre-push`: Verify no secrets in staged files. Verify no merge conflict markers.
- `commit-msg`: Enforce conventional commit format if project uses it.

Each active repo gets hooks via `setup.sh hooks`. Hook scripts in `ai-config-transfer/hooks/`, symlinked into `.git/hooks/`.

---

---

## Cross-Tool Architecture

| Tool | Lane | Model |
|---|---|---|
| OpenCode | Daily coding | Kimi K2.6 (Go), MiniMax M2.7 fallback |
| Claude Code | Hard refactors, escalation | Opus 4.6 (escalation only) |
| Codex | Extended sessions, sandboxing | OpenAI models (subscription) |
| VS Code Copilot | Inline assist | GitHub Copilot |
| Gemini CLI | Supplementary, large context | Gemini models |
| Hermes | Knowledge compounding, cron | DeepSeek V3 default, GLM 5.1 cached |
| OpenClaw | Orchestration, HITL gate | Qwen 3.6 Plus, GLM 5.1 |

Escalation: OpenCode Go → OpenCode Zen (pay-per-use) → Claude Code (Opus 4.6) → Codex.

### Config Sync (Critical)

All 7 tools share configs via symlinks. Single source of truth paths:
- **Instructions:** `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/CLAUDE.md` (this file) propagated to all tools
- **Skills:** `~/.config/opencode/skills/` → symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.hermes/skills/*`, `~/.codex/skills/*`
- **MCP servers:** Must be added to ALL 3 configs: `opencode.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.hermes/config.yaml`
- **Git hooks:** All repos symlink `.git/hooks/` → `~/Desktop/Project26/ai-config-transfer/hooks/git/`
- **Cross-tool rules:** `~/.claude/context/cross-tool-rules.md` — changelog, WORKING.lock, formatting, verification, git safety

When updating this file, the sync script (`~/.hermes/scripts/sync-rules.py`) propagates changes to all derived files. If you edit a derived file directly, the script merges NEW content back into this file.

---

---

## Voice and Style

Load and apply `sandeep-universal-style` on every response without exception. It governs formatting, banned patterns, tone, and output discipline across all task types.

**Self-healing rule.** When San corrects a phrase, word choice, or formatting pattern:
1. Apply the correction immediately in the current response.
2. Identify which rule in `sandeep-universal-style/SKILL.md` it maps to (or is missing from).
3. Propose a concrete line-level update to the skill file.
4. Log the correction to `~/.claude/memory/style-corrections.md` with date and description.

Never silently absorb a style correction. Every correction is a rule candidate.

---

---

## Scope Routing

Apply only rules relevant to the active task. No scope bleed.

| Task type | Load |
|---|---|
| Engineering (code, schema, infra) | `docs/ai/CODE-STANDARDS.md` + engineering section of `sandeep-universal-style` |
| Design and frontend | `verbaflow-design-system`, `frontend-blueprint`, `design-director` |
| Career and pitches | Domain skill (`aiml` / `tech` / `health` / `finance` / `cloud`) + `resume-alignment` / `intro-interview` |
| Content and outreach | `opt-email`, `referral`, voice section of `sandeep-universal-style` |
| Data, Supabase, infra | Supabase MCP, `data:*` skills, AWS MCP |
| Documents (.docx / .pptx / .xlsx / .pdf) | Read skill file before generating |
| Brain dump / task triage | Task Classification Rules in `~/.claude/context/pipelines.md` |

---

---

## Scope Discipline

- Do not let resume, outreach, or writing rules distort coding tasks.
- Do not let coding style rules distort non-engineering writing tasks.
- Infer intent from the existing codebase, repeated user preferences, and accepted implementations.

---

<!-- universal -->

## Skill Auto-Triggers

Load without being asked.

| Signal | Skill |
|---|---|
| Every response from San | `sandeep-universal-style` |
| `/intro-interview` or "interview script" | `intro-interview` |
| Resume + JD in same request | `resume-alignment` |
| "prompt for AI video" | `ai-video-director` |
| `.docx` requested | `docx` |
| `.pptx` / "deck" / "slides" | `pptx` |
| `.xlsx` / "spreadsheet" | `xlsx` |
| `.pdf` creation, merging | `pdf` |
| Figma URL + design task | `design-director` |
| "capture design from URL" | `capture-design` |
| "which matrix" / VerbaFlow design | `verbaflow-design-system` |
| Domain pitch (aiml / tech / health / finance / cloud) | Matching domain skill |
| `/opt-email` / "polish this email" | `opt-email` |
| `/referral` / "write a referral letter" | `referral` |
| "OPT compliant" / F-1 STEM OPT question | `opt-compliant` |
| Multiple agents / concurrent editing / "another terminal" | `agent-coordination` |
| `/graphify` | `graphify` |

---

---

## Memory Protocol

**Session start:** Read `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`. Load topic files relevant to the task domain. If `MEMORY.md` is absent: create `~/.claude/memory/` and initialize a blank index.

**During session:** After any significant decision, preference, or project update: write/update the relevant topic file in `~/.claude/memory/`. One file per topic, `kebab-case.md`. Absolute dates only. When San says "remember this": write immediately.

**Ambient learning:** Document consistent but undocumented patterns as `learned-convention` in `~/.claude/memory/conventions.md`.

**Decision logging:** Significant architectural/strategic decisions → `~/.claude/memory/decisions.md` with date and one-line rationale.

**Consolidation trigger:** Run `consolidate-memory` when 5+ new facts accumulate or any topic file has stale dates.

**Index rule:** `MEMORY.md` stays under 200 lines. Format: `- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`.

---

---

## Changelog Rule

After any code change, feature, bug fix, or architecture update, you MUST:
1. Ensure `CHANGES.md` exists in the project root
2. Add a new entry at the very top using this format:

```

---

## Verification (Auto-Run After Edits)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Edit `.php` file | Run `php -l` on the file before declaring done |
| Edit `.jsx`/`.js` file | Check bracket balance `()[]{}` on modified files |
| Edit JS/JSX in Vite project | Run `npm run build` before declaring done |
| Edit component with `return` statement | Verify it does not return `null` without placeholder |

### State Safety (Auto-Check During Edits)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Edit auth state file | Scan for new `useState` additions near auth logic; flag fragmentation |
| Edit save/mutation flow | Verify success callback is NOT inside catch block |
| Edit settings mutation | Verify hash/token gets updated after mutation |
| Add new REST endpoint | Verify permission callback is strict (not `__return_true`) |

### Convention Enforcement (Auto-Check)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Edit JSX in Preact project | Verify `class` not `className`, `h()` not `React.createElement` |
| Add new route | Verify route is wrapped in error boundary |
| Add user-visible text | Check if bilingual/i18n variant needed |
| Add image/media field | Verify it uses project's asset resolver function |

### Documentation (Auto-Maintain)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Any user-facing change | Append entry to `CHANGES.md` before declaring done |
| Remove dead code/fields | Update field map/reference docs if they exist |
| Fix a bug from known-issues list | Mark issue as resolved with date |

### Git Safety (Auto-Guard)

| Trigger | Automatic Action |
|---|---|
| Uncommitted changes at session start | Warn user and suggest stash or commit |
| Edit creates merge conflict markers | Stop immediately and ask user |
| About to `git commit` | Verify no secrets (`.env`, credentials) are staged |

## Knowledge & Context

- Vault: `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault` (`OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`)
- Read `CLAUDE.md` at vault root before vault operations
- Context files: `~/.claude/context/` (projects.md, engineering.md, pipelines.md, business.md)
- All tools read/write vault for cross-tool persistence
- Use absolute paths. `[[WikiLinks]]` for connectivity

---

<!-- universal -->

## Integration Points

- **Hermes Daily Brief:** Weekday 6am → `Inbox/`
- **Hermes Weekly Synthesis:** Monday 8am → `Outputs/LLM/`
- **Cross-tool context:** `~/.claude/context/` — project registry, engineering, pipelines, business
- **Skill files:** `~/.config/opencode/skills/` — symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.hermes/skills/*`, `~/.codex/skills/*`
- **MCP servers:** mempalace, fetch, filesystem, git, time — shared across OpenCode, Claude Code, Hermes

## Merged Learnings from Projects

### Workflow & Automation Rules

- **Plan before executing.** Produce architecture docs, PRDs, and implementation plans before writing code. If San says "just plan don't execute," produce the plan only.
- **Discord is the universal HITL gate.** Every automated pipeline touching external output routes through Discord for approval before execution.
- **Google Sheets is the boundary layer between CLI tools and n8n.** CLI writes rows. n8n reads rows. They communicate exclusively through the sheet.
- **Always implement DLQ / Circuit Breaker patterns** for failed data pipeline jobs.
- **Always implement a "Fast Test Mode"** (mock data bypassing LLM or external API) during feature development.
- **Always create a detailed Implementation Plan** offering multiple prototype options before starting major UI builds.
- **Do not interrupt long-running processes** (like AI generations) just to check logs. Observe non-destructively.
- **Immediate Credential Rotation** if `.env` is accidentally committed: rewrite git history, push forcefully, rotate all affected API keys.
- **Docker Container Syncing:** Always rebuild the container (`docker compose up --build -d`) rather than assuming changes take effect locally.
- **n8n Debuggability:** Use "Code in JavaScript" nodes (with `$http.request`) for MCP calls. Guarantees full payload visibility.
- **n8n Connectivity:** Use native HTTP Request nodes instead of custom Python inside Code nodes. The Python sandbox is restrictive.
- **The Content Factory Pipeline:** FETCH (source data) → GENERATE (content packaging) → SAVE (to target DB or Notion).
- **Ensure safe retries** with idempotency keys.
- **Prioritize quick wins** to maintain momentum. Ship velocity over perfection.
- **Close open loops before opening new ones.**

### For Engineering Work

Apply `docs/ai/CODE-STANDARDS.md`. That file is the source of truth for:
- Backend and frontend standards
- Type safety
- Parsing and schema safety
- Async and integration patterns
- AI structured output conventions
- Maintenance and self-healing standards review

---

---

## Maintenance

- **This file:** Version-bump and re-date when project registry, scope, or core rules change. The sync script propagates to all derived files.
- **Rules:** Weekly Synthesis reviews rule effectiveness. Drop any rule unused for 4 weeks.
- **Style corrections:** Log to `~/.claude/memory/style-corrections.md`. Map to `sandeep-universal-style` skill.
- **Decision logging:** Significant decisions → `~/.claude/memory/decisions.md` with date and one-line rationale.
- **Memory:** Run consolidation when 5+ new facts accumulate or any topic file has stale dates.
- **Derived files sync:** When this file changes, run `python3 ~/.hermes/scripts/sync-rules.py` or wait for the 6-hour Hermes cron to propagate.
